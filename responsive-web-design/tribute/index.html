            you kind of want to eat something, but not something big, like an
            actual meal? Goldfish. When you just want a snack you can sit back
            and watch your favorite videos but don't feel like walking to the
            microwave for popcorn? Goldfish. The snack that gives you the excuse
            to talk in a high-pitched voice and puppet it around before enjoying
            it?...What...no, not animal crackers! GOLDFISH.
